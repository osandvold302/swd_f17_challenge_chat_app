Hello!

This project is for the ECE 3330 Introduction to Software Design Programming Challenge

We will be creating a multi-user chat application in android which uses a database given by our instructors to
store information about the chat groups that people are currently in and will store the messages that each user has with each other
or that a channel (or group chat) contains.
